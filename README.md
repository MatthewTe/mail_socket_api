# SMTP/IMAP mail "socket" API
This is the repository for the mail socket api. It wraps logic around the SMTP and IMAP Client objects that allows a web server (primarily gmail) to serve as a means of data transfer for small, easily base64 encoded data. The purpose of this package is to allow data transfer from a device running special modelling software onto another deice that performs the web hosting services for the data pipeline output.

This package was written as part of the [CDL dfs datapipeline project](https://github.com/users/MatthewTe/projects/2).
